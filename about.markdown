With over 15 years of IT experience, I began my career in 2008, specializing in Unix servers and IT infrastructure, where I managed essential services such as HTTP servers (Apache/Nginx), VPN servers, firewalls, and more.

In 2015, I transitioned into software development, focusing on the Apple ecosystem. Since then, Iâ€™ve primarily worked on native iOS applications, leveraging Swift to build high-quality, user-centric mobile experiences.
